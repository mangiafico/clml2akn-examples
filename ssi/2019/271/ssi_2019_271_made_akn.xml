            <p>These Regulations prohibit the manufacture and the sale of plastic stemmed cotton buds and come into force on 12 October 2019.</p>
            <p>Regulation 3 provides that it is an offence for a person to manufacture, supply, offer to supply, or have in their possession for supply, any plastic stemmed cotton bud. A person found guilty of such an offence will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5,000 or on conviction on indictment to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or a fine not exceeding £5,000 or both.</p>
            <p>Regulation 4 makes provision for offences by bodies corporate, Scottish partnerships and unincorporated associations.</p>
            <p>Regulation 5 provides that a local authority may authorise any person to exercise any of the powers specified in regulation 6.</p>
            <p>Regulation 6 makes provision for enforcement officer powers of entry and associated powers to carry out investigations in order to determine whether an offence under regulation 3 has been, or is being, committed. It also includes provision for entry under warrant, where the use of force to effect entry may be required.</p>
