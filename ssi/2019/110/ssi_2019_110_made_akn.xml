            <p>These Regulations make provision about early years assistance, a type of assistance that is given by the Scottish Ministers under Part 2 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018.</p>
            <p>In particular, they amend the eligibility rules for the pregnancy and baby grant (which is a form of early years assistance). Those eligibility rules are set out in the Early Years Assistance (Best Start Grants) (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (“the principal Regulations”).</p>
            <p>Regulation 5 adjusts the definition of “application window” in the principal Regulations so that an application can be made from the 24<sup>th</sup> week of a pregnancy.</p>
            <p>Regulation 6 amends the definition of “dependant” in the principal Regulations so that it includes dependants recognised in an award of state pension credit and people in kinship care arrangements.</p>
            <p>Regulation 7 provides for how the period allowed for a re-determination is to be calculated where the request for a re-determination is made late and the individual is found to have a good reason for not making the request sooner.</p>
            <p>Regulation 8 amends the principal Regulations to provide further circumstances in which a determination is to be made without an application. Regulation 4 makes a consequential amendment to the method of calculating the date of an application.</p>
            <p>Regulation 9(2) clarifies that if an individual has already been given, or is due to be given, a sure start maternity grant in respect of a baby, the individual is not also eligible for a pregnancy and baby grant in respect of that baby. Sure start maternity grant is defined for this purpose by paragraph 10 of schedule 2 of the principal Regulations. The sure start maternity grant is the equivalent in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to the pregnancy and baby grant in Scotland.</p>
            <p>Regulation 9(3) and (4) makes provision to restrict multiple payments where there is a change in responsibility for a child within a family unit and regulation 9(5) amends a residence rule so that habitual residence in the United Kingdom will be treated in the same way as habitual residence in the European Economic Area (<abbr class="acronym" title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or Switzerland, should the United Kingdom cease to be a member of the EEA.</p>
            <p>A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared in respect of the principal Regulations. These Regulations do not alter the outcome of that assessment. Accordingly, no further assessment is required.</p>
