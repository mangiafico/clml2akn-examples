            <block name="comment">(This note is not part of the Regulations)</block>
            <p>These Regulations insert a new regulation 7A into the Welfare of Farmed Animals (Scotland) Regulations 2010 (“the 2010 Regulations”). The new regulation 7A provides that a person responsible for a farmed animal must not attend to that animal, unless that person is acquainted with any relevant animal welfare guidance and has access to it while attending to that animal.</p>
            <p>The person responsible must also take all reasonable steps to ensure that any other person employed or engaged by the person responsible does not attend to any such animal, unless that other person is acquainted with any relevant animal welfare guidance (as defined in the Regulations), has access to a copy of it while attending to the animal, and has received instruction on how to comply with the guidance.</p>
            <p>By virtue of regulation 11 (offences) of the 2010 Regulations, it is an offence for a person responsible for a farmed animal to, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, contravene or fail to comply with new regulation 7A (or to cause or permit any such contravention or failure).</p>
            <p>A copy of the animal welfare guidance referred to in new regulation 7A(2) can be viewed on, or downloaded from, the Scottish Government’s website. Copies can also be obtained from, or inspected at, the offices of the Scottish Government’s Agriculture and Rural Economy Directorate, Animal Health and Welfare Division, Saughton House, Broomhouse Drive, Edinburgh EH11 3XD.</p>
            <p>No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.</p>
