            <p>This Order sets out the governance arrangements for Abertay University (“the University”), replacing the arrangements set out in the University of Abertay Dundee (Scotland) Order of Council 1994, which is revoked.</p>
            <p>Article 1 provides that the Order comes into force on 1 September 2019. Article 2 provides various definitions of terms that are used in the Order.</p>
            <p>Articles 3 and 4 in Part 2 of the Order make provision for the University. Article 3 narrates the change of name of the University to Abertay University and of the governing body to the University Court of Abertay University and provides that references to previous names of both are to be read as references to the new names from the date of coming into force of this Order. Article 4 sets out the objects of the University.</p>
            <p>Articles 5 to 15 in Part 3 of the Order make provision for the University Court. Article 5 makes provision for the powers and functions of the University Court, which are further set out in schedule 1. Article 6 provides that the University Court may delegate its powers, functions and duties but sets out matters that must not be delegated. Article 7 provides for the University Court to make appropriate financial arrangements for the University, which includes keeping accounts and investing funds. Further provision for financial arrangements is set out within the powers and functions of the University Court in schedule 1.</p>
            <p>Article 8 sets out the composition of the University Court which is to comprise a Chair of Court who is the senior lay member by virtue of section 8 of the Higher Education Governance (Scotland) Act 2016 (“the 2016 Act”), the Principal and Vice-Chancellor (“the Principal”), one or two Vice-Principal and Deputy Vice-Chancellors (“Vice-Principals”) nominated by the Principal, two persons elected by and from the staff of the University, two persons nominated by a trade union with a connection to the University (one from among the academic staff and one from among the support staff), two persons nominated by the students’ association, one person nominated by the Senate and 10 to 14 members appointed by the University Court (“lay members”).</p>
            <p>Article 9 makes further provision for the appointment of the Chair of Court who is to be appointed in accordance with the 2016 Act and an appointment process prescribed by the University Court.
