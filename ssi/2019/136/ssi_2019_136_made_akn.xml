            <p>This Order reconstitutes the Lerwick Port Authority in line with the recommendations contained within “Modern Trust Ports for Scotland: Guidance for good governance”, as published by Transport Scotland in 2012. It provides for the Board to consist of a body of eleven members with experience in relevant matters. Nine persons will be appointed by the Authority. The Chief Executive and one other senior officer of the Authority will also hold office as members. Under the terms of the Order the appointed members will retire in rotation.</p>
            <p>The Order also includes other provisions with respect to the Board’s constitution including requirements as to publication of its annual statement of accounts, and repeals, revokes or amends certain statutory provisions. It also consolidates certain provisions contained within the 1999 and 2003 Orders.</p>
