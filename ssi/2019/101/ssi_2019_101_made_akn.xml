            <heading>EXPLANATORY NOTE</heading>
            <block name="comment">(This note is not part of the Order)</block>
            <p>Article 11(1) of Regulation (<abbr class="acronym" title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy (<abbr class="acronym" title="Official Journal">OJ</abbr> L 354, 28.12.2013, p.22) empowers EU member States to adopt conservation measures which are necessary for compliance with obligations under EU environmental legislation.</p>
            <p>The Loch Carron Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area Order 2019 (“the 2019 Order”) designated that part of the Scottish marine area which is within Loch Carron as a nature conservation marine protected area (“the Loch Carron MPA”). The 2019 Order provides that flame shell beds and maerl beds within Loch Carron are protected features.</p>
            <p>This Order furthers the stated conservation objectives for the Loch Carron MPA.</p>
            <p>Article 3 describes the area protected by this Order (“the protected area”). It is the seabed and subsoil and all of the water covering the seabed within the Loch Carron MPA.</p>
            <p>Article 4 prohibits and regulates activities within the protected area.</p>
            <p>Article 4(2) provides that a person must not deploy or use any fishing gear within the protected area. The term “fishing gear” and associated terms are defined in article 4(5) of the Order.</p>
            <p>Article 4(3) regulates the storage of fishing gear on fishing vessels within the protected area.</p>
            <p>Article 4(4) provides that article 4(2) and (3) does not apply to activities carried out in the protected area for the purpose of saving life or for the purpose of securing the safety of a vessel, aircraft or marine structure.</p>
            <p>Article 5 provides that of section 97(1)(b) (exception to certain offences where act authorised by a public authority etc.) of the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 does not apply in relation to an offence under section 94 of that Act of contravening this Order or an offence under section 95 of that Act committed in relation to the protected area.</p>
            <p>A person who contravenes this Order commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £50,000, and on conviction on indictment to an unlimited fine.</p>
            <p>Article 6 revokes the Loch Carron Urgent Marine Conservation (No. 2) Order 2017 and the Loch Carron Urgent Marine Conservation (No. 2) Order 2017 (Urgent Continuation) Order 2018.</p>
            <p>A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment (“BRIA”) has been prepared in relation to this Order and placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Copies of this BRIA can be obtained from Marine Scotland, Victoria Quay, Edinburgh EH6 6QQ.</p>
