            <block name="comment">(This note is not part of the Regulations)</block>
            <p>These Regulations make provision in Scotland for the implementation and administration of Regulation (EU) 2016/1012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on zootechnical and genealogical conditions for the breeding, trade in and entry into the Union of purebred breeding animals, hybrid breeding pigs and the germinal products thereof (“the Animal Breeding Regulation”) (<abbr class="acronym" title="Official Journal">OJ</abbr> L 171, 29.6.2016, p.66).</p>
            <p>Regulation 2 designates the Scottish Ministers as the competent authority for the purposes of the Animal Breeding Regulation.</p>
            <p>Regulation 3 provides that the competent authority is responsible for the enforcement of the Animal Breeding Regulation in Scotland.</p>
            <p>Regulation 4 provides that notices served by the competent authority on operators may be sent by post or in electronic form and provides certain requirements which must be met in order for a notice sent in electronic form to be treated as given. The term operator is defined in the Animal Breeding Regulation as any natural or legal person subject to the rules provided for in the Animal Breeding Regulation.</p>
            <p>Regulation 5 makes provision for an obligation on an operator to inform the competent authority of changes to the contact details of that operator.</p>
            <p>Regulation 6 provides for penalties in the event that an operator infringes its obligations under the Animal Breeding Regulation.</p>
            <p>Regulation 7 provides a mechanism whereby breed societies and breeding operations may apply to the competent authority for a reconsideration of a decision to withdraw the recognition of that breed society or breeding operation under Article 47 of the Animal Breeding Regulation.</p>
            <p>Regulation 8 amends the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (“the <abbr class="acronym" title="Termination Amount">TA</abbr>
               <abbr class="acronym" title="Retail Price">RP</abbr> (Scotland) Regulations”). The TARP Scotland Regulations govern the import of live animals and products of animal origin into Scotland from outside the EU. Regulation 13 of the TARP Scotland Regulations provides for certain checks which must be carried out on such consignments at Border Inspection Posts (“BIPs”). The Commission periodically publishes lists of BIPs. The list of approved BIPs is laid down in Commission <ref eId="c00007" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/decision/2009/0821">Decision 2009/821/EC</ref> (OJ L 296, 12.11.2009, p.1) as last amended by Commission Implementing <ref eId="c00008" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/european/decision/2011/0707">Decision 2011/707/EU</ref> (OJ 281, 28.10.2011, p.29) and is periodically reviewed and amendments made.</p>
            <p>Article 37 of the Animal Breeding Regulation makes provision for checks to be carried out at BIPs in relation to pure bred animals.
