            <p>These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act <ref eId="c00007" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2018/16">2018 (c.16)</ref> in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(d) and (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.</p>
            <p>These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the fields of environmental protection, town and country planning, electricity works, and hazardous substances.</p>
            <p>Regulation 2 amends the Town and Country Planning (Development Planning) (Scotland) Regulations 2008; Regulation 3 amends the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2013; Regulation 4 amends the Town and Country Planning (Hazardous Substances) (Scotland) Regulations 2015; Regulation 5 amends the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017; and Regulation 6 amends the Electricity Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017. The amendments made by these Regulations ensure that references to the relevant European Union Directives are amended to be references to the relevant Directive as it had effect immediately before exit day.
