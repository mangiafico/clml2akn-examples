            <p>These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Optical Charges and Payments) (Scotland) Regulations 1998 (“the principal Regulations”) which provide for payments to be made by means of a voucher system in respect of costs incurred by certain categories of persons in connection with the supply, replacement and repair of optical appliances.</p>
            <p>Regulation 6 amends regulation 13 of the principal Regulations to require suppliers of optical appliances, unless a voucher has been issued by a Health Board, to make claims for payment by means of electronic communication.</p>
            <p>Regulation 6 also inserts paragraphs (2B), (2C) and (2D) into regulation 13 of the principal Regulations which provide that where a voucher has been issued by a Health Board, suppliers of optical appliances can make claims for payment either by means of electronic communication or on a duly completed voucher to the responsible authority.</p>
            <p>Regulation 8 amends regulation 18 of the principal Regulations to require suppliers replacing or repairing optical appliances, unless a voucher has been issued by a Health Board, to make claims for payment by means of electronic communication.</p>
